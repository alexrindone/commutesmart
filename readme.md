<br><br>**Note**: Testing by running `flutter test --coverage` will generate `coverage/lcov.info`. Running `bash test-coverage.sh` will parse the `lcov.info` file into JSON format. This happens automatically within the CI/CD pipeline on a pull request to master but it is always good to test locally.
