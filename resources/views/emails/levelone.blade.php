        <p>Congratulations on logging your first trip!  You are now in the “Snowflake” level of smart commuting.  We’ll be sending you some fun stickers and a magnet as a small thank-you gift.
            <br /><br />
            The next level is “Icicle” (16 trips) that comes with a pair of warmers to slip into your gloves or shoes. 
            <br /><br />
            Thanks so much for commuting smart and logging your trips!
            <br /><br />
