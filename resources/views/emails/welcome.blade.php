        <p>Greetings!
            <br /><br />
            Thanks so much for registering for the Conquer the Cold Challenge!  We’re thrilled that you’re biking, riding a moped, walking or taking the bus in the cold weather. 
            <br /><br />
            Please let me know if you have any questions.
            <br /><br />
            Your wallet, your planet, and I thank you for signing up for the challenge.
            <br /><br />
            Best regards,
            <br /><br />
